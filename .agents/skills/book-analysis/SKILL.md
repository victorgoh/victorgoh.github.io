# Book Analysis Skill

## Overview
This standalone skill enables any agent to perform a high-quality introduce book study for a given Bible reference, text, or topic.

## Guidelines & Objectives
When executing this skill:
- Always run the python script located at `.agents/skills/book-analysis/book_analysis_retriever.py` to search the local database for baseline book introductions.
- Execute the script using: `python3 .agents/skills/book-analysis/book_analysis_retriever.py "<Book>"` (you can also pass language options like `--sc` or `--tc` if a Chinese translation is preferred, or the script will auto-detect Chinese characters).
- Retrieve and use the local database output as the baseline information. Combine it with your assigned persona, theological perspective, and relevant Scripture references to fully expound the book in detail.
- Keep explanations biblically accurate and structurally clear.
- Cite specific book, chapter, and verse references for all statements.
- Ensure that the output is comprehensive, addressing all prompt criteria without skipping sections.
- Focus strictly on the requirements of this specific study type.
